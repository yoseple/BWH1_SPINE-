# BWH1_SPINE-
Project for CS410

The BWH1- Spine Simulation project aims to develop a realistic simulation of the lumbar region of the spine within a game physics engine. The primary objective is to create an interactive representation of lower back discomfort by simulating the reaction of the spine module. This simulation will include animations of the spine experiencing pain or force, as well as visual indicators of the affected area.

For the Unity Package. Have Unity Downloaded and then open up Unity in a new project and then open the package and add it to your project.

For the Unreal model, have unreal downloaded and then use the  unreal project file (Spine3D.uproject under Spine3D_Unreal) to add to your project.
